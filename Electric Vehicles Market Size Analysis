## Electric Vehicles Market Size Analysis using Python

This is the first project in the 200+ data science projects series. In this analysis, I used a real-time dataset up to 2024 to examine the electric vehicles (EV) market size. The project includes:

- Data exploration to understand EV market trends.
- Visualization of market insights using graphical plots.
- Model evaluation to assess predictive performance.
- Analysis of top EV makers and car models.
- Forecasting EV registration in the US for the next six years.
